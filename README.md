#android-example-simple

This Android Studio project represents a very simple implementation of the Smartwhere Proximity SDK.

**The ProximityConfiguration class must be modified to reflect the target account values for the application id, api key and secret values.  These values are available on the web administrator under section Admin -> Account Information _You must be an account administrator to view these values_**
